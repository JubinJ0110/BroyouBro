        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Team Members: Jubin J.</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Proposal Last Updated: 10/29/21</p>
        
        <p>Application Overview: For my final project I want make a python program that 
            retrieves stocks information when a user inputs a stock ticker symbol. It'll be a 
            python program that you can run in your terminal.</p>
        
        <p>Technology Overview:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Alpha Vantage API</li>
            <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
            <li>RapidAPI</li>
            <li>Time, Datetime and requests Library</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Feature List:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gives back Stock Information</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Future Feature List:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ask stock related questions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Basic Technical Features: Use of python</p>
        <p>Advanced Technical features: API calls, pip3, performance counter timer</p>
        
        <h2>What was Originally Planned:</h2>
        <p>Have a Python application that could retrieve stock data for that day 
            when the user entered a stock ticker symbol</p>

        <h2>What was Delivered in my Final Project:</h2>
        <p>A Python Application that can return 5-6 months of daily stock data 
            and 20 years worth of weekly stock data when the user inputs a stock 
            ticker symbol. Shows the time and date, how long the user has spent 
            in the application and how long it took to get the results. I also 
            had it loop through aking for stock information. Made sure there 
            were error messages when the user enters an invalid input.</p>
        
            <h2>What Features I'd add with more time:</h2>
            <p>I'd use pandas to maybe try and organize the data better. 
                Or I would try and figure out tkinter to maybe make it 
                look more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
